Since you're here can I assume you're interested? hmm..

Well, I like to code to solve problems and I am highly dedicated towards achieving whatever goal I set. I believe in learning through applying and my long list of projects back that fact up. I am highly interested in creating `Applications` or `Softwares` that make life easy and truly contribute to evolving trend and changes.
