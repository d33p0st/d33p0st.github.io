Since you're here can I assume you're interested? hmm..


Well, I like to code to solve problems and I am highly dedicated towards achieving whatever goal I set. I believe in learning through applying and my long list of projects back that fact up. I am highly interested in creating `Applications` or `Softwares` that make life easy and truly contribute to evolving trend and changes.

### Interests

My interests towards technology is specific and I want to design and develop solutions that truly matter. As for my other interests, I like `Gaming`, playing `Guitar` and `Piano`. As a matter of fact I am a co-founder of an `Alt/Rock` boy band named `The Coffee Smirk`.
